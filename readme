## How to Run This Project

You will need two terminals running at the same time: one for the backend and one for the frontend.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.10+
* PostgreSQL (with pgAdmin)
* Node.js (which includes npm)

### 1. Backend Setup (Flask API)

1.  **Create the Database:**
    * Open pgAdmin and create a new, empty database named `ngo_db`.
    * Open the Query Tool for `ngo_db`, paste the entire contents of `schema.sql` into it, and run the script. This will create all 12 tables.

2.  **Install Python Packages:**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate it (Windows)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Install required packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Your Password:**
    * Open `app.py` and change the `DB_PASS` variable to your own PostgreSQL password.

4.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    python -m flask run
    ```
    *Your backend is now running on `http://localhost:5000`.*

### 2. Frontend Setup (React App)

1.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd ngo-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Node Modules:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    *Your frontend is now running on `http://localhost:3000` and will open in your browser.*
